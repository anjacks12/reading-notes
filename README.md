# Welcome to My 102 Reading Notes

Hello, my name is Angela and welcome to my Reading Page! I've always had a bare-bones approch to anything related to technology. I've been interested in coding for a while I decided to take the plunge with Code Fellows and start learning. So far, it has been a whole new world, a bit scary, but definetly fun! This is where I'll be tracking my Code Fellows journey by sharing the things I learn along the way. I'm excited to see where rhis journey leads!
