# Welcome to My 102 Reading Notes

Hello, my name is Angela and welcome to my Reading Page! I've always had a bare-bones approch to anything related to technology. I've been interested in coding for a while I decided to take the plunge with Code Fellows and start learning. So far, it has been a whole new world, a bit scary, but definetly fun! This is where I'll be tracking my Code Fellows journey. Hopefully I'll be able to display all the cool stuff I learn! I'm excited to see where I'll end up!
