# Welcome to My Reading Notes

Hello, my name is Angela and welcome to my Reading Notes! In the past, I've always shyed away from anything related to technology. It always seemed so complex and intimidating, yet over the last few years I've found myself becoming more interested in technology. So, *INSTEAD* of remaining in my technology-free bubble, I've decided to **CHALLENGE** myself and take the plunge with Code Fellows to start learning more about coding, technology, and the tech industry.

I've recently finished the 102 class and am excited to begin 201. This whole new world so far has been faced-paced, overwhelming :dizzy_face: and stressful :weary: at times... also a bit scary :scream: too but definitely a lot of fun! :grin: No one said it was going to be easy but I'll keep chugging along as best I can and see how things turn out!

I'll continue to track what I'm learning in 201 through the 201 Reading Notes for the next 10 weeks so stay tuned for what's ahead! Let the journey continue...
