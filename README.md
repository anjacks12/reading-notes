### What is Growth Mindset?

Growth mindset is embracing challenges and obstacles as an _opportunity_ for personal growth and development.

### 3 Reminders for Myself to Keep a Growth Mindset:

- Don't tell yourself it is impossible. There's a way. It may take some time to figure out
- Keep **going**! Any movement is better than **NO** movement!
- Give yourself a :+1:! You're doing something new and that's fun!
