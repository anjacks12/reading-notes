# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## [Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming by John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/understanding-the-problem-domain-is-the-hardest-part-of-programming)

* Understanding the Problem Domain makes programming easier
* What is Problem Domain? It wasn't explicitly covered in the article but it sounds like using coding/programming to solve a problem
  * Having a clear path on how to look at the Problem Domain as a whole and then determining the steps to get to the solution is important
    * To do this, it is important to either make the problem domain easier (more simplified) or have a better understanding of the problem domain

## [Whatâ€™s the difference between primitive values and object references in JavaScript? by Chris Geelhoed](https://betterprogramming.pub/intermediate-javascript-whats-the-difference-between-primitive-values-and-object-references-e863d70677b)

* Two categories for all data types in JS: primitive values and object references
  * 8 data types total (7 primitive and 1 object)
    * Primitive values: boolean, null, undefined, number, BigInt, string, symbol
    * Object reference: includes arrays, functions, and dates
* Variables with primitive values have the value directly assigned to the variable whereas, objects are "stored" in the computer's memory until the data is needed or referenced
* Primitive values are immutable; Object references are mutable

### Notes were made from Jon Duckett's JavaScript & jQuery books (see Resources)

## Chapter 3: Object Literals (pp. 100-105)

* In an object:
  * a variable is called `property`; the name of property is `key` and the value can be string, number, Boolean, array or another object
  * a function is called `method`; represents tasks associated with the object; the name of method is `key` and the value is always a function


## Chapter 5: Document Object Model (pp. 183-242)
