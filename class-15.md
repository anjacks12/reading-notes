## Article Summary

* This article written in The New York Times Magazine by Charles Duhigg is about Google's attempt in finding out what made the perfect team in 2012. This was done through Project Aristotle.
* Those involved in the project looked at various data from the different groups within Google to see if there was a pattern that emerged that distinguished the successful teams from the not-so-successful ones
  * They evaluated factors like: how often people met outside of work, if they had similar interests or personalities
  * In the end no clear-cut pattern was seen as to why certain teams worked better than others
* A breakthrough came when the focus began to shift from who made up the groups to what the "group norms" were
  * They discovered that if a group was aware and adhered to what was officially or unofficially the normal behavior when coming together as a group, the group seemed to function better
  * From this, the researchers were able to hone in and focus on which group norm facilitated a strong, productive group
  * They found that there were two behaviors that lead to a group's success:
    * "Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking"
      * This means each individual in the group had equal amount of time sharing or speaking when together
    * "Average social sensitivity"
      * This means the individuals within a group were able to detect other group member's emotions through non-verbal cues
  * These two behaviors in a group allowed there to be "psychological safety" where each member of the group felt they were in a safe space to be heard when speaking, without the fear of their ideas/suggestions being shot down
* The conclusion of the article revisits the importance of having a group dynamic where team members can feel safe in having difficult conversations, while also establishing emotional connections; these factors are vital to the success of a group
