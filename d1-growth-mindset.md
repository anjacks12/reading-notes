# What is Growth Mindset?

Growth mindset is embracing challenges and obstacles as an _opportunity_ for personal growth and development. Many times we often look at challanges and obstacles as a sign to stop our pursuit of something or confirmation of our short-comings. The growth mindset teachs us that is not true, that dilligance, determiniation and commitment are all major factors in whether we succeed or fail. In short changing the, "I can't" into "I can'~~t~~". 

### 3 Reminders for Myself to Keep a Growth Mindset:

- When you feel anxious or start to panic, take a breath and tell yourself to calm down. It will get done, it's just a matter of when.
- Keep **going**! Any movement is better than **NO** movement!
- Give yourself a :+1:! You're doing something new and that's fun!
