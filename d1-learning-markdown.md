# Learning Markdown
I’ll admit, when I first learned about Markdown in class I just saw a bunch of symbols that didn’t seem to make any sense. But the more we dove into it, I realized that all those symbols placed in the right order, brought ordinary text to life. The “order” of the symbols is called syntax and the power of syntax is that it gives those who are creating pages on the web the tools they need to make something amazing! Are you interested?

Let’s say you wanted to create the quote and image below. How would you do that? See below:
>"Do. Or do not. There is no try."
>>-Yoda, *The Empire Strikes Back*

1. Type: `>"Do. Or do not. There is not try."` making sure there is no space between the `>` and the quote. This will create what is called a "blockquote"
2. Hit enter. A line with an angled bracket `>` will automatically appear. Enter another angled bracket `>`, this will indent the blockquote and here is where we will cite who the quote came from and where it came from. It should look like:


    `>>-Yoda, \*The Empire Strikes Back*`. Make sure there is no space between the words and `*`. The `*` will italicize *The Empire Strikes Back*
5. Hit enter twice so there is a space between the last line and the final line
6. This is where the image will go by typing `![image name](url)`. For this example, it should look like:

    -`![yoda](https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2013/11/01-400x225.jpg)`
    
Hopefully that wasn't too confusing! :grin:
