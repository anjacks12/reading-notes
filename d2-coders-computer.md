# Meet the Terminal
Today I was introduced to the terminal. The term that was frequently used to describe it was, "looking under the hood" and getting a look at what really happens when you create a new file and save it to a certain directory. It's a great analogy because like how easy to forget all the mechanics and machinery that is required to dirve a car, it is easy to forget all the amazing things that happen that allows us to create new files and directories, rename them or move them around that we don't see when using a UI.

The seems like it can be a very big place/space. Especially depending on how may files and directories you have... and I get the feeling I'm going to start having quite a few after this week ðŸ˜† So to help me, I've included some shortcuts below along with a few notes I've pick up while doing my reading. 

## Cheat Sheet
* pwd = present working directory
  + This shows your current locaton in the terminal
* cd [location] = change directory
  + This allows you to move to a different directory
* ~ = a shortcut for your home directory
  + This saves you time and typing so instead of `home/jack/Documents`, all you would need to type is `~/Documents` to get to the same place
*
