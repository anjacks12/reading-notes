# Meet the Terminal
Today I was introduced to the terminal. "Looking under the hood" is often how the terminal is described because when you are creating a new text file and making changes, you don't see all the commands that are executed to make those changes happen in an UI. It's a great analogy because like how easy it is to forget all the mechanics and machinery that is required to dirve a car, it is easy to forget all the amazing things that happen that allows us to create new files and directories, rename them or move them around that we don't see when using a UI.

The terminal seems like it can end up being a very big place/space, especially depending on how may files and directories you have... and I get the feeling I'm going to start having quite a few after this week ðŸ˜† So to help me, I've included some shortcuts below along with a few notes I've pick up while doing my reading. 

## Cheat Sheet
* pwd = present working directory
  + This shows your current locaton in the terminal
* cd [location] = change directory
  + This allows you to move to a different directory
* ~ = a shortcut for your home directory
  + This saves you time and typing so instead of `home/jack/Documents`, all you would need to type is `~/Documents` to get to the same place
* mkdir [file or directory name] = make a new file or directory
* ../ = moving up in a directory
* ls = list command
  + This gives a list of the files in a file or directory

There are so many more shortcuts but I'll end my list here. I"m sure there will be more to come in the future!
