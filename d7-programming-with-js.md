## Expressions, Operators, and Functions
+ JS uses binary, unary operators, and a special ternary conditional operator
    + binary operators: requires an operator and 2 operands (values)

        i.e. operand1  operator  operand2
        + where the operator is between the two operands
    + unary operator: requires only one operator and the operand is either before or after the operator

        i.e. operand  operator or operator operand

+ Expressions are any valid unit of code that resolves a value
+ Functions: are fundamental building blocks in JS
    + similar to a procedure
    + takes input and returns with an output
