## Types of Loops:
+ for statement
    + loop repeats until a specified condition is false
+ do...while statment
    + repeats until a conditon is false
+ while statment
    + executes statement as long as the condition is true
    + can become infinite loops; can be avoided by making sure the condition eventually becomes false
+ break statement
    + terminates a loop
+ continue statement
    + can be used to restart a while loop, do-while, for, or label statement
+ for...in statement
    + iterates a specific variable over the enumerable properties of an object
